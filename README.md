# LearningPytorch

## 00 Files
  - *Learn Pytorch Fundamentals*
  - Learned how to create a tensor
  - Learned how to create reproducible randomized tensors with `torch.manual_seed(number)`*Note number can be changed to any integer value*
  - Check if we have GpU or not with `device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'`
  - Learned how to put tensors on GPU with `tensor.to(device)`
  - Learned How to put them back on the CPU with `tensor.`

## 01 Files
  - Learn Gradient Descent from the ground up
  - Learn how to perform gradient descent with PyTorch
  - Used Gpu
  - Create a PyTorch model using `nn.Parameter()`
  - Create a PyTorch model using `nn.Linear()`
  - Learned how to save our models' learned Parameters with `torch.save(obj = model.state_dict(), f='path/name_of_model.pth')`
  - Learned how to load the Parameters with `torch.load`

## 02 Files
  - Apply Gradient Descent with PyTorch to a more concise dataset
  - Used the make_circles data set from `sklearn.datasets.make_circles`
  - Perform Classification on it

## *Happy Learnig 😁😉👌. Don't give up💪👍*

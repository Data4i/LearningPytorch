# LearningPytorch

- *00 files is where I learn PyTorch fundamentals like tensors and so on*

- *01 files is where I learn how gradient descent works and how to create and fit a model using PyTorch*

- '02 files is where I learn how to apply what I learned in 01 to a more concise dataset and deal with basic classification tasks'
